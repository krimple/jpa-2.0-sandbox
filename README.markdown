# Hibernate JPA Demo

In our Hibernate classes, we frequently need to kick around a sandbox
project.  This project was built using Spring Roo, which was then
factored out.  It is a simple JPA 2.0 project using Hibernate and
Hypersonic SQL.

To build, just issue mvn package.

To test, just issue mvn test.
